This program recursively finds all the anagram(s)
for the word input by user and terminates when the
input string matches the EXIT constant defined
at line 19

If you correctly implement this program, you should see the
number of anagrams for each word listed below:
    * arm -> 3 anagrams
    * contains -> 5 anagrams
    * stop -> 6 anagrams
    * tesla -> 10 anagrams
    * spear -> 12 anagrams
